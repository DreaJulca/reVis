ADVANCE MONTHLY SALES FOR RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICES

JUNE 2001
The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce announced today that advance estimates of U.S. 
retail and food services sales for June, adjusted for seasonal, holiday, and trading-day 
differences, but not for price changes, were $292.9 billion, an increase of 0.2 percent (±1.0%)
from the previous month and up 4.0 percent (±1.7%) from June 2000. Total sales for the April
through June period were up 4.0 percent (±1.5%) from the same period a year ago. The April to
May 2001 percent change was revised from +0.1 percent (±1.0%) to +0.4 percent (±0.3%). 

Retail trade sales increased 0.2 percent (±1.0%) from May and were 3.7 percent (±1.7%) above 
last year. Health and personal care stores were up 9.3 percent (±3.6%) from last year and sales
of building materials and garden equipment and supplies dealers increased 7.8 percent (±5.9%)
from June a year ago. Motor vehicle and parts dealers were up 6.3 percent (±3.5%) from last
year. 

The advance estimates are based on a small subsample of the Bureau's full retail and food
services sample. Estimates from the advance and the subsequent full survey can differ because
of the earlier reporting in the advance and because of sampling variability present in both 
surveys.

SOURCE:Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services--JUNE 2001 (Press Release 
available without charge from Public Information Office, Bureau of the Census
Washington, D.C. 20233). Survey methodology and measures of sampling
variability are documented in the Advance Press Release. Questions
concerning this report should be directed to Mr. Scott Scheleur

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reliability of Estimates
The Advance estimates are based on a small subsample of the Bureaus full retail sales sample. Estimates from the Advance and the subsequent full survey can differ because of the earlier reporting in the Advance and because of sampling variability present in each survey. The margin of sampling error, as used on page 1, gives a range about the estimate which is a 90% confidence interval. If, for example, the trend estimate is +1.2% and the standard error is 0.9%, then the margin of sampling error is ±1.65 x 0.9% or ±1.5%, and the 90% confidence interval is -0.3% to +2.7%. If the interval contains 0, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. For monthly level, the coefficient of variation (CV) is given. The resulting confidence interval is the estimated value ± 1.65 × CV × (the estimated value). Estimates of sampling variability are given in Table 3. 

Estimates from the Advance and the full survey are subject to nonsampling errors. Such errors can occur because of nonresponse, insufficient coverage of the universe of retail businesses, and response errors. Additionally, estimates of sales prior to March 2001 have been restated from SIC-based estimates. The restatement methodology may have introduced additional nonsampling error. Precautionary steps are taken to minimize nonsampling errors, but their magnitude is not directly measured. 

Preliminary estimates for the current month and final estimates for the previous month based on the full sample will be published next month in the Monthly Retail Trade Report. This report will provide sales estimates in greater detail and additional measures of sampling variability. It will also present a description of revisions and the techniques used in developing the estimates, and an explanation of confidence intervals and sampling variability (Appendix B, Reliability of Estimates).
