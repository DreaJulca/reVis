ADVANCE MONTHLY SALES FOR RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICES

MAY 2001

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special Notice:

The data in this report are based on a new sample and reflect the results from the latest Census of Retail Trade and the 1999 Annual Retail Trade Survey. This initial release, and all subsequent releases, uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) in place of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Previously, on June 1, the unadjusted and adjusted data series from January 1992 through April 2001 were published on a NAICS basis and can be found on our website at http://www.census.gov/mrts/www/mrts.html. For further information on NAICS, including publication stubs for the new release, see our web site at http://www.census.gov/mrts/www/naics.html 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce announced today that advance estimates of U.S. retail and food 
services sales for May, adjusted for seasonal, holiday, and trading-day differences, but not for price changes,
were $291.3 billion, an increase of 0.1 percent (±1.0%) from the previous month and up 3.8 percent (±1.7%) from 
May 2000. Total sales for the March through May period were up 3.0 percent (±1.5%) from the same period a year 
ago. The March to April 2001 percent change was revised from 1.1 percent (±1.0%) to 1.4 percent (±0.3%). 

Retail trade sales were virtually unchanged from April, but were 3.6 percent (±1.7%) above last year. Health and
personal care stores were up 8.5 percent (±3.6%) from last year and sales of building materials and garden 
equipment and supplies dealers increased 7.4 percent (±5.9%) from May a year ago. Gasoline stations were 6.8 
percent (±4.8%) above May 2000 and motor vehicle and parts dealers were up 3.4 percent (±3.5%) from last year. 

The advance estimates are based on a small subsample of the Bureau's full retail and food services sample. 
Estimates from the advance and the subsequent full survey can differ because of the earlier reporting in the 
advance and because of sampling variability present in both surveys.

SOURCE:Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services--MAY 2001 (Press Release 
available without charge from Public Information Office, Bureau of the Census
Washington, D.C. 20233). Survey methodology and measures of sampling
variability are documented in the Advance Press Release. Questions
concerning this report should be directed to Mr. Scott Scheleur

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reliability of Estimates
The Advance estimates are based on a small subsample of the Bureaus full retail sales sample. Estimates from the Advance and the subsequent full survey can differ because of the earlier reporting in the Advance and because of sampling variability present in each survey. The margin of sampling error, as used on page 1, gives a range about the estimate which is a 90% confidence interval. If, for example, the trend estimate is +1.2% and the standard error is 0.9%, then the margin of sampling error is ±1.65 x 0.9% or ±1.5%, and the 90% confidence interval is -0.3% to +2.7%. If the interval contains 0, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. For monthly level, the coefficient of variation (CV) is given. The resulting confidence interval is the estimated value ± 1.65 × CV × (the estimated value). Estimates of sampling variability are given in Table 3. 
Estimates from the Advance and the full survey are subject to nonsampling errors. Such errors can occur because of nonresponse, insufficient coverage of the universe of retail businesses, and response errors. Additionally, estimates of sales prior to March 2001 have been restated from SIC-based estimates. The restatement methodology may have introduced additional nonsampling error. Precautionary steps are taken to minimize nonsampling errors, but their magnitude is not directly measured. 

Preliminary estimates for the current month and final estimates for the previous month based on the full sample will be published next month in the Monthly Retail Trade Report. This report will provide sales estimates in greater detail and additional measures of sampling variability. It will also present a description of revisions, the techniques used in developing the estimates, and an explanation of confidence intervals and sampling variability (Appendix B, Reliability of Estimates).
